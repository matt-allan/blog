The Laravel web framework makes it dead simple to stitch together disparate parts of your application with [events](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/events).  If you haven't used events before, they are really useful for 'side effects'.

- example of sending notifications to Slack, Email, etc

- explain issue with transactions

- explain solution

- discuss 'at most once'

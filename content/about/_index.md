I'm a full stack developer living off grid just outside of Asheville, NC.  These days I'm building our house and writing about software development.

## My Work

Over the years I've built web applications, online stores, REST APIs, IoT devices, software libraries, and a lot more.  Of course I built this website too. üòÅ

I've built a lot of apps with the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) PHP framework and I'm active in the community writing, giving talks, contributing features, and fixing bugs.

If you are looking for a Laravel expert feel free to <a href="mailto:matt@mattallan.me">reach out</a>. I'm not taking contract work right now but I might be able to help.

## Colophon

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).  The HTML and CSS is written from scratch.  You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/matt-allan/blog).
